This folder contains Python code
https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-vision/Instructions/Labs/04-image-classification.html

to perform image classification using
the Azure Custom Vision service.
The code demonstrates how to:
- Connect to the Custom Vision service
- Create and manage image classification projects
- Train and evaluate image classification models
- Make predictions using trained models
Prerequisites:
- An Azure account with access to the Custom Vision service
- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python packages installed (e.g., azure-cognitiveservices-vision-customvision)
- Sample images for training and testing
Instructions:
1. Set up your Azure Custom Vision resource and obtain the necessary keys and endpoint URLs.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip.
3. Update the code with your Custom Vision resource details.
4. Run the code to create a project, upload images, train a model, and make predictions.
For detailed instructions and code examples, refer to the lab guide linked above.
